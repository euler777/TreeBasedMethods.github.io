# Tree-Based Methods

Tree-based methods partition the feature space into a set of rectangles, and then fit a simple model (like a constant) in each one. They are conceptually simple yet powerful. We describe a popular method for tree- based regression and classification called CART (Classification And Regression Trees, see Breiman et al., 1984). Compared to ordinary least squares, tree- based methods are less accurate, less consistent, but the algorithm runs much faster especially when the number of predictors is large. I mainly refer to the textbook “The Elements of Statistical Learning” by Hastie et al. for this chapter.

Main goal: To understand the motivation and idea of tree-based methods. To know using tree- based method to model quantitative data (regression tree) and classification problems (classification tree).
